Simple Blockchain in Python

Overview

This project demonstrates how to create a simple blockchain in Python. 
The blockchain includes functionalities for creating blocks, adding transactions, performing proof of work, and verifying the blockchain's integrity.

Features:

Create Blocks: Initialize and add new blocks to the blockchain.
Add Transactions: Add transactions to the current block.
Proof of Work: Implement a basic proof-of-work algorithm.
Hashing: Hash blocks using SHA-256.
Chain Integrity: Verify the blockchain's integrity by ensuring hashes link correctly.

Requirements:

Python 3.x
No additional libraries are required for this basic implementation.
